# Sample georeferenced survey data

This directory contains the cave survey data for the
[Dow Cave - Providence Pot system](http://www.mudinmyhair.co.uk/ "Mud in My Hair")
(Great Whernside, Wharfedale, UK), and is
essentially a snapshot of the data held in the
[Cave Registry Data Archive](http://cave-registry.org.uk/ "Cave Registry"), re-organised into folders.

Note that the `.svx` files have
[unix-style line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline "wikipedia")
so on Windows you might have to use something like
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++")
to look at them.
