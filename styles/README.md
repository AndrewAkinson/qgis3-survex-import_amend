# QGIS color style files

This directory contains QGIS style files for coloring imported cave
survey data (points, lines, polygons) by (mean) elevation, either
using specified ranges or interpolating between the `zmin` and `zmax`
variables.  See discussion in the [`README`](../README.md)
in the top level directory.
