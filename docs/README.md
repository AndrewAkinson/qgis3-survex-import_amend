# Documentation

For a general description of how cave surveying and GIS can play
together see
[`cave_surveying_and_GIS.pdf`](cave_surveying_and_GIS.pdf).  The
emphasis is on survex and QGIS, illustrated with the data set in the
`example` directory.  The source for this PDF is the LaTeX file
[`cave_surveying_and_GIS.tex`](cave_surveying_and_GIS.tex), processed
using `pdflatex`.

For the current plugin see the [`README`](../README.md)
in the top level directory, which includes installation instructions.
