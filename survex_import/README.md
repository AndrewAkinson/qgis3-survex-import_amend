# Plugin code

To install, copy this directory (not just the contents) to 
`python/plugins/` in the current active profile,
the location of which can be found from within QGIS3 by going to
'Settings &rarr; User Profiles &rarr; Open Active Profile Folder'.

Alternatively if you have `pb_tool` you can run `pb_tool deploy` in
this directory.
