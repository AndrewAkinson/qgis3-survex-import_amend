# Plugin code (version 1.0)

To install, copy this whole directory to
where QGIS3 looks for the python plugins (\*).  Alternatively if you
have `pb_tool` you can run `pb_tool deploy` in this directory.

(\*) under unix (linux) this is likely to be
```
~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins
```
Otherwise determine the location from within QGIS3 by 'Settings &rarr;
User Profiles &rarr; Open Active Profile Folder'.
